# GAN Project

This repository contains a project demonstrating the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow. The project is entirely localized within a Jupyter notebook file named Project.ipynb. The GAN model is trained to generate new, synthetic data based on an input dataset. This project utilizes several popular Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
## Requirements

To successfully run the code in this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

    TensorFlow: An open-source platform for machine learning.
    Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
    Matplotlib: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
    Pandas: A fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install tensorflow seaborn matplotlib pandas

## Project Structure

    Project.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code for this project. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Usage

    Clone the Repository:

    Clone this repository to your local machine using:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GAN-Project.git

Navigate to the Directory:

Change your working directory to the cloned repository:

bash

cd GAN-Project

Install the Requirements:

Install the required libraries using pip (if not already installed):

bash

pip install tensorflow seaborn matplotlib pandas

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Start Jupyter Notebook and open Project.ipynb:

bash

    jupyter notebook

    In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the Project.ipynb file and open it.

    Execute the Cells:

    Follow the instructions within the notebook, executing each cell sequentially to train the GAN and generate synthetic data.

## Key Components

    Data Loading and Preprocessing:
    The notebook starts with loading and preprocessing the input dataset using Pandas.

    Model Building:
    The GAN model is constructed using TensorFlow, consisting of a Generator and a Discriminator.

    Training:
    The training loop trains the GAN by alternating between training the Discriminator and the Generator.

    Evaluation and Visualization:
    The results are visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib, showcasing the performance of the GAN and the quality of the generated data.
